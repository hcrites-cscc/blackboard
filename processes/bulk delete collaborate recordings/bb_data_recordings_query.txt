Notes:
============================================
This is useful for identifying undeleted Collaborate recordings by a specific date range.  You can adjust the WHERE clause to search for specific courses, terms, last viewed dates, or other criteria.

In the query, replace the following variables with your institution-specific values:
	[start_date]: enter a start date for the look ups
	[end_date]: enter an end date for the look ups

Alternatives:
	cm.end_time < [date] --look up recordings before a specific date
	cm.last_playback_time between [start_date] and [end_date] --look up last playback between two dates





============================================
Returns:
============================================
  TERM_NAME: the name of the term in which the course is associated. Will return empty for group-based recordings or courses without a term association.
  COURSE_ID: the course_id of the course
  COURSE_NAME: the name of the course
  ROOM_NAME: the name of the Collaborate room
  RECORDING_ID: the primary key of the recording in Bb Data
  RECORDING_NAME: the name of the recording
  RECORDING_DURATION: the length of the recording in seconds
  RECORDING_SIZE: the size of the recording in bytes
  RECORDING_CREATED: the date and time the media was created
  START_TIME: the date and time the media started. For example, when a recording started.
  RECORDING_LAST_PLAYBACK: the date and time when the recording was last played
  FULL_NAME: a concatenation of room name and recording name - matches the return values from the REST API.
