============================================
Notes:
============================================
This is useful for identifying pools which can be deleted due to non-use.

In the query, replace the following variables with your institution-specific values:
	[course_pk1]: enter the specific course_main.pk1 value to look up a specific course





============================================
Returns:
============================================
  COURSE_PK1: the pk1 value of the course
  COURSE_ID: the course_id of the course
  QAD_PK1: the pk1 value of the pool
  TITLE: the title of the pool
  BLOCK_COUNT: the number of blocks using this particular pool
  	
	

	
============================================
Query:
============================================
select pool.crsmain_pk1 as course_pk1
	, course_main.course_id
	, pool.pk1 as pool_pk1
	, pool.title
	, count(block.pk1) as block_count
from qti_asi_data as pool
inner join qti_asi_data as section on section.parent_pk1 = pool.pk1
inner join qti_asi_data as question on question.parent_pk1 = section.pk1
inner join course_main on course_main.pk1 = pool.crsmain_pk1
left outer join qti_block_mapping as block on block.question_pk1 = question.pk1
where pool.crsmain_pk1 = [course_pk1]
	and pool.bbmd_asi_type = 1
	and pool.bbmd_assessmenttype = 4
group by course_main.course_id, pool.crsmain_pk1, pool.pk1, pool.title
order by pool.title
