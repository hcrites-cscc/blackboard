Notes:
============================================
This query targets file embeds in discussion board posts.  It is useful for identifying files in use by location, cross-linked content (files in course home directories being used by other courses) and missing files (files which have been deleted but are still being referenced).

SaaS DDA uses multiple databases for cms_doc and the base schemas. To connect the two databases, I use the dblink function in PostgreSQL. If your instance does not have this installed, open a ticket to request it.

In the query, replace the following variables with your institution-specific values:
	[your_saas_schema]: use your specific SaaS schema value
	[your_dda_username]: use your DDA username
	[your_dda_password]: use your DDA password
	
To narrow down the query by specific course, there are two elements to adjust:
	[course_pk1]: enter the specific course_main.pk1 value to look up a specific course
	[file_location]: enter the specific xyf_urls.full_path value to look up a specific location

Searching a specific file location will run much quicker than searching all of xyf_urls.




============================================
Returns:
============================================
  COURSE_PK1: the pk1 value of the course
  CONTENT_PK1: the pk1 value of the content
  CNTHNDLR_HANDLE: a hard-coded 'Discussion Post' to identify the type of content
  SUBJECT: the title of the discussion post
  COURSE_ID: the course_id of the course
  URL_COUNT: the number of files found in the discussion post
  XID: the Xythos ID number found in the message of the discussion post
  ENTRY_ID: the Xythos ID number of the embedded file
  FULL_PATH: the web folder file location of the embedded file
  MSG_TEXT: the full body of the message text
