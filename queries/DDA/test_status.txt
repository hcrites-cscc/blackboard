============================================
Notes:
============================================
This is useful for identifying unused tests, surveys, or pools that may be deleted.

In the query, replace the following variables with your institution-specific values:
	[course_pk1]: enter the specific course_main.pk1 value to look up a specific course





============================================
Returns:
============================================
  COURSE_PK1: the pk1 value of the course
  COURSE_ID: the course_id of the course
  QAD_PK1: the pk1 value of the test
  TITLE: the title of the test
  QUESTION_COUNT: the number of questions in the test
  DEPLOYED_IND: either 'deployed' or 'not deployed' - denotes whether the test has been deployed
  USING_IND: either 'using' or 'not using' - denotes the number of questions being used as a block in another test
